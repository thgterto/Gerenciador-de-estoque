## 2025-05-23 - Accessibility of Icon Buttons
**Learning:** When using icon fonts (like Material Symbols) in buttons, simply adding `aria-label` to the button isn't enough. Screen readers may still try to read the ligature text (e.g., "content_copy") which is confusing.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to the icon element itself when an accessible label (visible text or `aria-label`) is provided.

## 2025-05-24 - Mobile Accessibility Parity
**Learning:** Mobile views often strip away `Tooltip` components (which are hover-based). This leaves icon-only buttons completely inaccessible to screen readers on touch devices unless explicit `aria-label` attributes are added.
**Action:** Always verify mobile-specific components (like `InventoryMobileChildRow`) and ensure they have `aria-label`s on icon buttons, even if the desktop equivalent relies on `Tooltip` for context.

## 2025-05-25 - Explicit Labels for Touch Targets
**Learning:** Helper components for mobile actions (like `MobileActionBtn`) often get created without `label` props, assuming icons are self-explanatory. This creates barriers for screen reader users on mobile where hover tooltips don't exist.
**Action:** Enforce a `label` prop on all mobile-specific action button components and map it to both `title` (for long-press) and `aria-label`.

## 2025-05-26 - Actionable ARIA Labels
**Learning:** When adding ARIA labels to buttons containing both symbols (like '-' and '+') and functionality, provide descriptive labels like 'Diminuir quantidade' rather than just 'Menos', and make sure the labels match the application's locale.
**Action:** Always provide descriptive ARIA labels for icon-only and symbol-only actions and set aria-hidden on the visual icons to prevent screen readers from reading both.
