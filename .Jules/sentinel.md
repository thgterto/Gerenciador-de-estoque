## 2025-02-23 - Missing Content Security Policy in Electron App
**Vulnerability:** The application lacked a Content Security Policy (CSP), leaving it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if any dependency or input handling was compromised.
**Learning:** Even "portable" offline-first Electron apps often load external resources (CDNs for fonts/scripts) and need CSP. Vite development mode complicates this by requiring `unsafe-eval`, but `unsafe-inline` for scripts can be avoided.
**Prevention:** Enforce CSP via `<meta>` tag in `index.html` as a standard practice for all Electron renderers, ensuring it covers both production (bundled) and development (HMR) needs without being overly permissive.
