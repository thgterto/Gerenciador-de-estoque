## 2025-05-23 - Information Exposure via Error Handling
**Vulnerability:** The Google Apps Script backend was exposing full stack traces in the JSON response when an error occurred (`stack: error.stack`).
**Learning:** This is a common pattern in development but dangerous in production. It reveals internal file paths, function names, and logic structure to potential attackers, aiding in reconnaissance.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize error messages sent to the client. Use `console.error` for internal logging (which goes to the platform's secure logs) and return generic or safe error messages to the user.

## 2025-05-24 - LFI Risk in Electron Window Handler
**Vulnerability:** The Electron `setWindowOpenHandler` was configured to `allow` non-http/https URLs by default (`return { action: 'allow' }`). This could allow `file://` URLs to open a new window if a malicious link was clicked, potentially exposing local files (Local File Inclusion).
**Learning:** Defaulting to `allow` in security handlers is a violation of "Deny by Default". In Electron, `allow` inherits permissions and can open local files if the URL scheme is `file://`.
**Prevention:** Always configure `setWindowOpenHandler` to `deny` by default. Explicitly whitelist protocols (e.g., `https:`, `mailto:`) that should be handled externally via `shell.openExternal`.

## 2025-05-25 - Network Exposure via Default Bind Address
**Vulnerability:** The Fastify server (`server/src/app.ts`) was binding to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) by default, exposing the local backend to the entire network. Coupled with a default JWT secret, this created a critical security risk.
**Learning:** Development tools often prioritize convenience (`0.0.0.0`) over security (`127.0.0.1`). When distributed as part of a portable app or local tool, this exposes users to network attacks.
**Prevention:** Always bind servers to `127.0.0.1` by default unless external access is explicitly required and secured. Use environment variables (e.g., `HOST`) to allow configuration for advanced use cases.

## 2025-10-24 - XSS Risk via document.write in Print Modals
**Vulnerability:** The `handlePrint` function in the QR code modal components used `document.write` to generate HTML for printing, embedding unsanitized item properties (`item.name`, `item.lotNumber`, `item.id`). This allowed malicious payload injection if a user saved an item with a crafted name like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
**Learning:** Even internal tool interfaces must sanitize input. Generating DOM strings via string interpolation (`document.write`) without HTML encoding is a dangerous pattern and a classic vector for DOM-based XSS.
**Prevention:** Ensure all user input is sanitized or encoded before it's injected into HTML strings, even for features like `window.print` or internal popups. Always HTML-encode `<, >, &, ", '` to their corresponding HTML entities.
