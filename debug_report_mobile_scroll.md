## 🔍 Debug: Mobile Scrolling Issues

### 1. Symptom
Scrolling is stuck or feels heavy/non-responsive on mobile screens, particularly in the Inventory and History tables.

### 2. Information Gathered
- **Affected Components:** `InventoryList` and `HistoryTable`.
- **Observation:** These components use `react-window` (`FixedSizeList`, `VariableSizeList`) for virtualization.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The container elements created by `react-window` lacked the necessary CSS classes to enable native iOS momentum scrolling (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`).
- **CSS Context:** `index.css` defines a `.overflow-y-auto` utility class that applies `overscroll-behavior: contain` and `touch-action: pan-y`, but this class was not applied to the virtualized lists.

### 3. Hypotheses
1. ❓ **Missing Momentum Scroll:** The most likely cause is the lack of `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` on the scrollable container.
2. ❓ **Overscroll Behavior:** The global `overscroll-behavior-y: none` on `body` might be preventing scroll if the inner container doesn't explicitly handle it.
3. ❓ **Touch Action:** Missing `touch-action: pan-y` might cause the browser to interpret gestures incorrectly.

### 4. Investigation

**Testing Hypothesis 1 & 3:**
- Checked `index.css`: Found that optimizations are scoped to `.overflow-y-auto`.
- Checked `InventoryList.tsx`: Uses `FixedSizeList` with `className="custom-scrollbar"`. It was missing `overflow-y-auto`.
- Checked `HistoryTable.tsx`: Uses `FixedSizeList` with `className="custom-scrollbar"`. It was missing `overflow-y-auto`.

### 5. Root Cause
🎯 **Missing CSS Class:** The `react-window` components generate a `div` that handles scrolling (`overflow: auto` inline), but without the `.overflow-y-auto` class, they miss the critical CSS properties for mobile touch experience defined in `index.css`.

### 6. Fix
```tsx
// Before
<FixedSizeList className="custom-scrollbar" ... />

// After
<FixedSizeList className="custom-scrollbar overflow-y-auto" ... />
```
Applied this change to `components/inventory/InventoryList.tsx` and `components/HistoryTable.tsx`.

### 7. Prevention
🛡️ Ensure all scrollable containers, especially those generated by virtualization libraries, explicitly include the `overflow-y-auto` (or `overflow-auto`) utility class to inherit mobile scrolling optimizations.
